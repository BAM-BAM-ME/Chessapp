# File Path

`Directory.Build.props`

# Source of Truth

Chessapp repo root â€” solution-wide MSBuild configuration.

# Why Replace

Establish a consistent analyzer level across all projects. This centralizes `AnalysisLevel` and `Nullable` so individual projects stay minimal.

---

## Replacement (full file content)

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Use the newest analyzer set available on the runner -->
    <AnalysisLevel>latest-all</AnalysisLevel>
    <!-- Opt into nullable reference types across the solution -->
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

---

## Validation steps

1. Commit the file at the solution root.
2. Push a branch and open a PR.
3. Confirm the build step restores and compiles without introducing new warnings beyond the per-project configuration.

## Notes

This file intentionally keeps policy lightweight; more rules can be added later when Core suppressions are reduced.
