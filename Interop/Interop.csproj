# File Path

`Interop/Interop.csproj`

# Source of Truth

Chessapp repo â€” Interop project.

# Why Replace

Keep `Interop` strict with `TreatWarningsAsErrors` while Core is temporarily baselined. This preserves high quality for interop/process code paths where correctness and resource handling are critical.

## Replacement (full file content)

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- Interop depends on Core for shared contracts (no reverse reference) -->
    <ProjectReference Include="..\Core\Core.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

---

## Validation steps

1. Save, commit, push.
2. CI should continue to treat new warnings in `Interop` as errors.

## Notes

No additional suppressions are added here; fix warnings in `Interop` as they arise.
