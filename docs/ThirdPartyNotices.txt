Third-Party Notices for ChessApp

This project may use the Stockfish chess engine (GPLv3) as a separate process.
If you distribute the engine with the application, you **must** include the official `LICENSE` and `AUTHORS` files from the Stockfish distribution. If you ship the GUI alone, instruct the user how to point the app to the engine.
